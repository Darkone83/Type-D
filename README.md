# Type D: Original Xbox TFT Display Project

**Type D** is a two-part open-source system for the original Xbox, bringing a modern, customizable, and fully themed display experience to your console. It replaces the stock jewel with a 240x240 TFT touch display, controlled by an ESP32-S3, and optionally pairs with the Type D Expansion module for live Xbox status telemetry.

## Build Instructions

### Type D Display 

#### Web Flasher: [![Type D Web Flasher](https://img.shields.io/badge/Web%20Flasher-Type%20D-green?logo=esp32&logoColor=white)](https://darkone83.github.io/type-d.github.io/)

1. **Install Arduino IDE** (recommended 2.x or later).
2. **Install the ESP32 board package** via Board Manager, and select your ESP32-S3 board.
3. **Install all required libraries** (see above).
4. **Setup board and options** Board: ESP32 Dev module, Flash size: 16MB, Partition Scheme: 16MB Flash (2MB APP/12.5MB FATFS), PSRAM: Enabled
5. **Open the `Type_D.ino` project** and verify it compiles.
6. **Flash the firmware** to your module using USB.
7. **Connect to WiFi** Connect the device via wifi and select your network with the custom portal.
8. **Upload files**: Log in to the File Manager via the web interface Http://<device-ip>:8080 and upload your media. 


   **Notes:**
   - If no gallery images are present, a ‚ÄúNo images found‚Äù screen will be shown.
   - File types supported are determined by firmware: common formats are `.jpg`,`.gif` (for UI assets).
   - Resource files should use names expected by your UI/menu code. you can access the resource uploader bu going to device=ip:8080/resource
   - Large image files may affect load speed; optimize/resize for best results.

## How It Works

- **Type D Display** runs as a stand-alone smart dashboard and animated photo frame, displaying images and menus when no Xbox is online.
- When a **Type D Expansion** module is active on the same network, the display instantly receives Xbox system telemetry and shows a themed overlay with the latest status‚Äîno configuration required.

## Notes

- GIF support is experimental at this point and can cause issues or crashes It's being looked into.
