**Type D** is a two-part open-source system for the original Xbox, bringing a modern, customizable, and fully themed display experience to your console. It replaces the stock jewel with a 240x240 TFT touch display, controlled by an ESP32-S3, and optionally pairs with the Type D Expansion module for live Xbox status telemetry.

## Build Instructions

### Type D Display 

#### Web Flasher: [![Type D Web Flasher](https://img.shields.io/badge/Web%20Flasher-Type%20D-green?logo=esp32&logoColor=white)](https://darkone83.github.io/type-d.github.io/)

#### Build Instructions
1. **Install Arduino IDE** (recommended 2.x or later).
2. **Install the ESP32 board package**
3. **Install all required libraries** (see above).
4. **Setup board and options** Board** ESP32 Dev module, Flash size: 16MB, Partition Scheme: 16MB Flash (2MB APP/12.5MB FATFS), PSRAM: Enabled
5. **Open the `Type_D.ino` project** and verify it compiles.
6. **Flash the firmware** to your module using USB.
7. **Connect to WiFi** Connect the device via wifi and select your network with the custom portal.
8. **Upload files** Log in to the File Manager via the web interface Http://<device-ip>:8080 and upload your media. 


   **Notes:**
   - If no gallery images are present, a ‚ÄúNo images found‚Äù screen will be shown.
   - File types supported are determined by firmware: common formats are `.jpg`,`.gif` (for UI assets).
   - Resource files should use names expected by your UI/menu code. You can access the resource uploader by going to device=ip:8080/resource. All required resources are in the FATFS Setup/resource folder.
   - Large image files may affect load speed; optimize/resize for best results.

## Hardware installation

### Display Preparation

1 **Solder jumper** You will need to solder the jumper pad to the leg directly next to it to bypass the power button. See the Image below for reference.
<div align=center>

</div>

2 **Locate power**: Reference the image below for positive and negative terminals. Pre-tin the negative pad with a bit of flux and decent solder.
<div align=center>
  <img src="https://github.com/Darkone83/Type-D/blob/main/images/Board%20prep/Posneg.png">
</div>

3 ** Install power wires** Trim your leads as short as possible and solder your positive and negative conductors. Silicone sheathed wire is recommended for routing and flexibility.

4 **Install Bezel** Peel the release paper from the screen and adhere it to the bezel

</div>

### Type S:

**Notice** Beyond this point, you will be physically modifying your controller. This is not reversible, as you will have to drill holes in your shell. It's strongly advised you use a shell that you're potentially alright with modifying.

**Required** You will need the <a href="https://github.com/Darkone83/Type-D/blob/main/stl/Type%20S%20Drill%20guide.stl">Type S drill guide</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Darkone83/Type-D/blob/main/stl/Type%20S%20Bezel.stl">Type S Bezel</a>. You can asso use the optional <a href="https://github.com/Darkone83/Type-D/blob/main/stl/Washer.stl">washer</a> if needed.

## How It Works

- **Type D Display** runs as a stand-alone smart dashboard and animated photo frame, displaying images and menus when no Xbox is online.
- When a **Type D Expansion** module is active on the same network, the display instantly receives Xbox system telemetry and shows a themed overlay with the latest status‚Äîno configuration required.

## Notes

- GIF support is experimental! Keep your GIF's under 1MB. Larger GIF's may work, but cause crashing of the firmware.
